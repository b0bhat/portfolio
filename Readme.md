# Portfolio
My portfolio website to showcase my projects and post writeups for anyone who might want to try something similar!

Built using bootstrap. Node.js and three.js is used to setup and render cool 3D effects.

Requires a browser that supports WebGL - most modern and mobile browsers should work.

Hosted on github pages and deployed via github.
